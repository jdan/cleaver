Cleaver supports several basic options for adding a bit of customization to
your presentations. These options are placed at the top of your document, in
YAML format. A typical option setup resembles the following.

    title: Basic Example
    author:
      name: Jordan Scales
      twitter: jdan
      url: http://jordanscales.com
    style: basic-styles.css
    output: basic.html

### title

The title of the slidshow.

**Default**: Untitled

### author

Several fields which, if included, populate a basic author "credits" slide at
the end of your presentation.

![author slide](https://i.cloudup.com/f0zVsUwqF0-3000x3000.png)

These fields include:

* **name**: Your full name
* **url**: A url to your website
* **twitter**: Your twitter handle (weibo also supported)
* **email**: Your email address

Please note that some characters must be escaped. For example, "@username"
would need to be wrapped in quotes. You can leave out the "@" when specifying
a twitter handle.

### theme

An optional theme to load. A theme is a directory, URL, or a github repo in
the form of *username/repo* that may contain stylesheets, javascript, or
rewritten templates. Themes group together many of the other options listed
in this article.

For example, check out the [retro theme](http://github.com/jdan/cleaver-retro).

For more information on themes, check out
[the documentation](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver/blob/master/docs/themes.md#options).

### style

An optional stylesheet to load. This can be either a URL, or an
absolute/relative path to a file. *Relative to the markdown document you are
sending to cleaver*.

These styles will be **appended** to Cleaver's default style. For more
fine-grained control, check out the docs on Theming.

### output

The filename (or absolute/relative path to a file) you wish to save your
output to.

**Default**: FILENAME-cleaver.html

### controls

An option determining whether or not you want to render simple navigation
buttons on your presentation.

**Default**: true

### progress

Displays a small progress bar at the top of your document.

**Default**: true

### encoding

Content encoding to use on the rendered document.

**Default**: utf-8

### template

URL or absolute/relative path to a mustache template used to render the slides.
See [default.mustache](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver/blob/master/templates/default.mustache)
for inspiration.

### layout

URL or absolute/relative path to a mustache template used to render the entire
slideshow. See
[layout.mustache](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver/blob/master/templates/layout.mustache)
for inspiration.

### base64

Allow the inclusion of resources as data uri, base64 encoded

For the moment, the only asset supported are local images (i.e. images present on the machine where cleaver is run, with a path relative to the md file) .

This is achieved with the following field:
* localImages (default to false)

The option is therefore:

    base64:
      localImages: true
