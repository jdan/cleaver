If you are using a theme from github, you can use `cleaver --cache path/to-something.md` to enable cache the theme into files.

## More Info

**Cleaver** is a one-stop shop for generating HTML presentations in
record time. Using some spiced up markdown, you can produce
good-looking, interactive presentations with a just a few lines of text.

Slides are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
and are separated by two dashes (`--`).

## Options

    title: Basic Example
    author:
      name: Jordan Scales
      twitter: jdan
      url: http://jordanscales.com
    style: basic-style.css
    output: basic.html

Cleaver supports several basic options that allow you to further customize the
look and feel of your presentation, including author info, stylesheets, and
custom templates.

See the documentation on
[options](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver/blob/master/docs/options.md) for more
information.

Be sure to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver/wiki) as well.

## Themes

Check out the [themes](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver/wiki/Theme-Index)
page on our [wiki](http://github.com/jdan/cleaver/wiki).

    title: Theme Example
    output: theme.html
    theme: jdan/cleaver-retro

Cleaver has substantial theme support to give you more fine-grained control
over your presentation, similar to [options](#options). Instead of manually
specifying a stylesheet, template, layout, and others, you can specify a single
theme containing each of these assets. More specifically, a theme may contain:

* style.css - styles for your presentation
* template.mustache - a template used to render the slides in your presentation
* layout.mustache - a template used to render the entire document of your
presentation
* script.js - javascript to be included in your slideshow

A theme does not need to contain all of these files, only the ones present
will be loaded into your slideshow.

### Examples

### Specifying Themes

Themes may be specified by one of the following options:

* An absolute or relative path to a directory
* A URL to a directory
* A github repository in the form of *username/reponame*

### Overriding Themes

By default, *style.css* and *script.js* will be **appended** to the default
stylesheets and javascripts included in cleaver presentations. If you wish to
completely override these defaults, you must include another file in your
theme - options.json - corresponding to the following:

```json
{
  "override": true
}
```

Template files will automatically override the default templates.

### More Info

For more information on themes, check out
[our documentation](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver/blob/master/docs/themes.md).

## Markup

Cleaver slides are rendered using the following template:

```handlebars
{{#slides}}
  <div class="slide{{#hidden}} hidden{{/hidden}} {{classList}}" id="slide-{{id}}">
    <section class="slide-content">{{{content}}}</section>
  </div>
{{/slides}}
```

And produce the following markup:

```
+-------------------------------+
| #slide-N                      |
|     +-------------------+     |
|     | .slide-content    |     |
|     |                   |     |
|     |                   |     |
|     |                   |     |
|     |                   |     |
|     +-------------------+     |
|                               |
|                               |
| (navigation)                  |
+-------------------------------+
```

**#slide-N** (for example, *#slide-3*) allows you to identify a particular
full-bleed slide by its position in the slideshow. It extends to the bounds of
the page.

**.slide-content** is a smaller window which holds the actual content of the
slide.

### Class List

A class list can be placed after each "slice" (denoted `--`) to help you
style individual slides without worrying about their index.

```
-- bg

This slide will have a class "bg" associated with it

-- bg blink

This one, too, but it will also have the class "blink"
```

## Slide Types

### Title slide

    # Cleaver 101
    ## A first look at quick HTML presentations

**h1** and **h2** elements (prefaced with *#* and *##* respectively), will
automatically include padding to render a title slide.

### Other slides

    ### A list of things

    * Item 1
    * Item B
    * Item gamma

    No need for multiple templates!

Since slides are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
you can include things like lists, images, and arbitrary HTML.

**h3** tags (prefaced `###`) are automatically given a bottom border to
represent a slide title.

## Navigation

Cleaver supports keyboard navigation for switching between slides.
Alternatively, click the control buttons located below the presentation.

To navigate the slideshow:

* **forward**: K, L, UP, RIGHT, PgDn, and Space
* **reverse**: H, J, LEFT, DOWN, PgUp, and Backspace

The toggle fullscreen mode, press the **ENTER** key.
