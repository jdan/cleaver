## More Info

**Cleaver** is a one-stop shop for generating HTML presentations in
record time. Using some spiced up markdown, you can produce
good-looking, interactive presentations without writing any code
or placing a measly textbox.

All you need to do is write some blocks of markdown, separated by `--`
on its own line and include metadata at the top.

Let's walk through the above example piece by piece.

### Metadata

    title: Basic Example
    author:
      name: "Jordan Scales"
      twitter: "@jdan"
      url: "http://jordanscales.com"
    output: basic.html
    controls: true

The first section of any cleaver document is the metadata. Currently cleaver supports
the following fields.

* **title**: The title of the slideshow
* **author**
    * **name**: Your full name
    * **url**: A url to your website
    * **twitter**: Your twitter handle
* **style**: An optional stylesheet to load
* **output**: A location to save the rendered document (default: *FILENAME-cleaver.html*)
* **controls**: A boolean representing whether or not arrow buttons should be included (default: *true*)
* **agenda**: A boolean representing whether or not to create an agenda slide after the title (default: *false*). These will be generated based on the titles of your other slides.

If author is included, the following slide will be automatically inserted
at the end of your presentation:

### Title slide

    # Cleaver 101
    ## A first look at quick HTML presentations

**h1** and **h2** elements (prefaced with *#* and *##* respectively), will
automatically include padding to render a title slide.

### Other slides

    ### A list of things

    * Item 1
    * Item B
    * Item gamma

    No need for multiple templates!

Since slides are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
you can include things like lists, images, and arbitrary HTML.

**h3** tags (prefaced `###`) are automatically given a bottom border to
represent a slide title.

### Navigation

To navigate the slideshow:

* **reverse**: H, J, LEFT, DOWN, and Backspace
* **forward**: K, L, ENTER, UP, RIGHT, and Space

Or click the buttons
